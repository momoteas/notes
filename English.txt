
1. 介词 + which: 在定语从句中的用法
		This is the house which I was born in.
		=This is the house in which I was born.
		=This is the house that I was born in.
		=This is the house I was born in.
		=This is the house where I was born.
		可以看出,in which = where,in which中的in也可以放到句子最后.就是说v+prep+地点时,可以用where,代替的就是prep+地点,如果用which,
	代替的就只是地点,所以在句中仍要用prep ,这样其实prep+which在定语从句中要确定这个prep用什么不是固定用法,而是要根据词组灵活搭配,前
	面举的例子中,因为是born in sw,所以用in which.你这句中的of which我想也是这样,因为有include of sth的用法,判断这个介词的时候,你就
	把这个介词拖到句末去看就是了.
	

2. may not be , may be not区别：
		may not be 是表示表示一种可能性,可能不是,而may be no表示肯定不是,例如
		[1] She may be not a student, ...
			Meaning => True, she is not a student
		[2] She may not be a student.
			Meaning => There is a possibility that she is not a student
			
			
3. 介词for:
		a. 表示目的：
			the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes.
			
			
4. whether:
		whether和if都可以引导宾语从句，表示“是否”，在口语或间接引语中两者可以互换使用。如：
			I wonder if / whether I can get some advice from you.
			Ask him whether / if he can come.
		
		但在有些情况下，whether和if的用法有一定区别。
			1. whether引导的从句常可以与连词or或or not直接连用，而if一般不能。如：
				正： Let me know whether you can come or not.
				误： Let me know if you can come or not.
		2. 当宾语从句提到句首时，只能用whether引导，而不能用if。如：
			正： Whether it is true or not, I can’t tell.
			误： If it is true or not, I can’t tell.
		3. whether可以引导带to的不定式，if则不能。如：
			正： I don’t know whether to accept or refuse.
			误： I don’t know if to accept or refuse.
		4. whether及其引导的成分可放于介词之后，作介词的宾语，但if不能。如：
			正： I worry about whether I hurt her feelings.
			误： I worry about if I hurt her feelings.
		5. whether可以引导从句，作主语、表语或同位语，而if不能。如：
			正： It was uncertain whether he would come.
			误： It was uncertain if he would come.
			正： His first question was whether Tom had arrived yet.
			误： His first question was if Tom had arrived yet.
			正： We must consider the question whether we will take these measures.
			误： We must consider the question if we will take these measures.
