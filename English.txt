		This is the house which I was born in.
		=This is the house in which I was born.
		=This is the house that I was born in.
		=This is the house I was born in.
		=This is the house where I was born.
		可以看出,in which = where,in which中的in也可以放到句子最后.就是说v+prep+地点时,可以用where,代替的就是prep+地点,如果用which,
	代替的就只是地点,所以在句中仍要用prep ,这样其实prep+which在定语从句中要确定这个prep用什么不是固定用法,而是要根据词组灵活搭配,前
	面举的例子中,因为是born in sw,所以用in which.你这句中的of which我想也是这样,因为有include of sth的用法,判断这个介词的时候,你就
	把这个介词拖到句末去看就是了.
