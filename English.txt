
1. 介词 + which: 在定语从句中的用法
		This is the house which I was born in.
		=This is the house in which I was born.
		=This is the house that I was born in.
		=This is the house I was born in.
		=This is the house where I was born.
		可以看出,in which = where,in which中的in也可以放到句子最后.就是说v+prep+地点时,可以用where,代替的就是prep+地点,如果用which,
	代替的就只是地点,所以在句中仍要用prep ,这样其实prep+which在定语从句中要确定这个prep用什么不是固定用法,而是要根据词组灵活搭配,前
	面举的例子中,因为是born in sw,所以用in which.你这句中的of which我想也是这样,因为有include of sth的用法,判断这个介词的时候,你就
	把这个介词拖到句末去看就是了.
	

2. may not be , may be not区别：
		may not be 是表示表示一种可能性,可能不是,而may be no表示肯定不是,例如
		[1] She may be not a student, ...
			Meaning => True, she is not a student
		[2] She may not be a student.
			Meaning => There is a possibility that she is not a student
			
			
3. 介词for:
		a. 表示目的：
			the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes.
			
			
4. whether:
		whether和if都可以引导宾语从句，表示“是否”，在口语或间接引语中两者可以互换使用。如：
			I wonder if / whether I can get some advice from you.
			Ask him whether / if he can come.
		
		但在有些情况下，whether和if的用法有一定区别。
			1. whether引导的从句常可以与连词or或or not直接连用，而if一般不能。如：
				正： Let me know whether you can come or not.
				误： Let me know if you can come or not.
		2. 当宾语从句提到句首时，只能用whether引导，而不能用if。如：
			正： Whether it is true or not, I can’t tell.
			误： If it is true or not, I can’t tell.
		3. whether可以引导带to的不定式，if则不能。如：
			正： I don’t know whether to accept or refuse.
			误： I don’t know if to accept or refuse.
		4. whether及其引导的成分可放于介词之后，作介词的宾语，但if不能。如：
			正： I worry about whether I hurt her feelings.
			误： I worry about if I hurt her feelings.
		5. whether可以引导从句，作主语、表语或同位语，而if不能。如：
			正： It was uncertain whether he would come.
			误： It was uncertain if he would come.
			正： His first question was whether Tom had arrived yet.
			误： His first question was if Tom had arrived yet.
			正： We must consider the question whether we will take these measures.
			误： We must consider the question if we will take these measures.
	
	
5. outside out区别:
		outside 更多的表示一种状态。
			<例> She is outside the room. 意为她在房间外。
			
		out在表示"在外面"时则需加介词补全
			<例> She went out of the room. 意为她走出了房间。
			
		现代英语的口语中也经常说She is out. 表示她不在家。		
		所以你给的句子中要将out改为outside, 也可以在后面加上of.不过在此outside表达意思更为准确
	
	
6. be of noun:
		be + of + noun可以理解为be+名词对应的形容词:

			比如 Team spirit is of importance. 团队精神很重要.

			这句话也就同Team spirit is important.意思一样.
			
			
7. though, although区别：
		①although和though同义,在一般情况下,可以互换使用.只是though较普遍,常用于非正式的口语或
		书面语中,而although则较为正式.另外although语气比though重,常用以强调让步概念；
			Though/Although my car is very old,I don't want to buy a new one.
			虽然我的汽车很旧,但我不想买一辆新的.
			He insisted on doing it although I warned him not to.
			虽然我警告他不要做,但他仍然坚持要做.
			
		②even能和though组合表示强调,但even不能和although组合：
			e.g.Even if/Even though we could afford it,we wouldn't go abroad for our vocation.
			即使我们付得起这笔钱,也不出国度假.
			
		③当让步状语从句指某种假设情况时,通常用though,而不用although：
			e.g.Though all the world were against me,I should still hold to my opinion.
			就算全世界都反对我,我还是坚持我的立场.
			Though everybody deserts you,I will not.
			即使所有人都抛弃你,我也不会的.
		
		④though可以独立用作副词,常放在句末,意为all the same (还是；仍然)或however(可是；然而),而although无此用法
			e.g.She didn't tell me what she had done,but I know it though.
			她没有告诉我她所做的事情,但我还是知道了.
			It's hard work.I enjoy it,though.
			工作很苦,可是我喜欢.
	
		⑤though引导让步状语从句时可以倒装,而although从句则不能.
			e.g.Bravely though they fought,they had no chance of winning.
			虽然他们打得很勇敢,但还是没有机会获胜.
	
	相同点：①在although和though引导的让步状语从句中,主句里不可用but,若要强调前后两部分的对比意义,可在主句前加yet或still.
			e.g.Although/Though he has a lot of money,yet/still he is unhappy.
			他虽然有很多钱,但并不幸福.
			
			
8. in, within区别：
		1.in：过……后（未来时间）
			注意：
				如果用于过去时,用after +时间：
					She went to Nanjing last May,and she came back after a month.
					去年五月她去了南京,一个月之后她又回来了.
				大多用在将来时（一般将来时和过去将来时）：
					in an hour 一小时之后
					in a week or so 一个多星期之后
					He will be back in five hours.他五小时之后回来.
		
		2.within：不超过……的范围
			比较：
				within强调在……时间之内,没有时态的限制.
				in是以现在为基准,in an hour是指从现在起1小时之后,所以一般只用于将来时.
					within 3 hours 3小时之内
					I must finish painting the cat within five minutes.我必须在五分钟之内画好这只猫.
